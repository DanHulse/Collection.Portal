# Collection.Portal
A front end for the [Collection.API] (https://github.com/DanHulse/Collection.API)

## Overview
This is an MVC6 web project targeting .NET Core that provides a front end to my Collection.API. It is intended to provide an easy way to view/add/edit records in my Collection database

##Setup
This project requires the latest release of .NET Core to build, it was also built in VS2017 and I've not tested compatibility with VS2015

All other requirements are restored through NuGet and Bower when built for the first time.

The appsettings.json file should contain the Url for the Collection.API.

## Current Status
Still very early

### To-Do
- [ ] Design of pages
- [ ] Returning data from API
- [ ] Supporting editing/adding of records
